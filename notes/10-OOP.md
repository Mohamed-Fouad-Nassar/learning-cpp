# OOP

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is about creating "objects", which can hold data (Properties or Attributes) and functions (Methods) that work on that data.

## Advantages of OOP

- OOP provides a clear structure to programs.
- Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug.
- Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.

The **DRY** principle means you should avoid writing the same code more than once. Move repeated code into functions or classes and reuse it.

## Classes and Objects

- **Class** is like a blue-print, it defines what an object should look like.

- **Objects** are instances from class, an object is created based on that class.

When we create an object from a class, it inherits all the variables and functions defined inside that class.

## Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming

**Procedural programming** is about writing functions that operate on data (code is organized around functions).

**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is about creating objects that contain both the data and the functions (code is organized around classes and objects).

## Main Concepts op OOP

There are four main pillars (sometimes 5 if you include **composition**):

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
